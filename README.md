# python-challenge

This In this MONASH UNIVERSITY DATA ANALYTICS BOOT CAMP/TRILOGY EDUCATION SERVICES homework consisted of two tasks **PyBank** and **PyPoll**.

## PyBank

* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analysing the financial records of my hypothetical company. I was given a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/James-Akerman/python-challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* My task was to create a Python script that analysed the records to calculated each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  
* My script also prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernise its vote counting process.

* I was given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](https://github.com/James-Akerman/python-challenge/blob/main/PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. My task was to create a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* My script also prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
